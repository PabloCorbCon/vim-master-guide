<p>Vim is an open-source text editor created in 1991 by <a href="https://github.com/brammool">Bram Moolenaar</a>. It is an improved version of the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi">Vi text editor</a>. In fact the name "Vim" comes from Vi+iMproved. Vim is normally pre-installed in most UNIX systems and with Apple OS X.</p>
<p>Vim has many things that make it different from other text editors, first of all it is incredibly configurable. In Vim you can change absolutely everything, from the smallest color to the entire structure. Vim configurations are portable and they are super easy to share, for example you can check my actual Vim configuration in <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/PabloCorbCon/vim-config">this</a> GitHub repository. Don't worry, we'll talk about how to configure Vim in next chapters.</p>
<p>Another super important characteristic of Vim is that you don't need to use a mouse for anything! Not having to move your hand from keyboard to mouse over and over can greatly improve your workflow. Everything you would normally do with a couple of clicks and a couple of buttons in an editor like Visual Studio code or SublimeText has a shortcut in Vim, a key combination that allows you to do the same.</p>
<p>There are other advantages of using the Vim text editor against others. Vim is completely open-source, and you can find it's code in <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim">this</a> GitHub repository</p>
<p>Vim is also super simple, therefore it doesn't consume almost any of the resources of your system, Since Vim does not use an interface, it does not have to load any interface library, which is often the cause of programs running much slower.</p>
<p>And then last but not least, Vim is fun! Of course, you have to spend part of your time learning how to use Vim, all its commands, how to move around  etc. But if you really like it, it is very satisfying to use the terminal to edit your files.</p>
