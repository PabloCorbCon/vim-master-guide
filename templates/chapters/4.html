<p>As we have said before, in the Vim text editor we do not have a mouse, the things that you would normally do with the mouse in any other text editor you cannot do.</p>
<p>To add grace to the matter, in a terminal (where we normally run Vim) we don't have any kind of button or anything like that. All the possible icons that we see are made with text.</p>
<p>This is why we have modes in Vim, as we cannot do everything we would normally do with a keyboard and a mouse with just a keyboard, we have to divide the editor into modes (or layers), so that the same keys have functions different</p>
<hr>
<h3>Normal mode</h3>
<p>If you open a file in Vim, as we explained in <a href="{{ url_for('chapter', cid=3) }}">the third chapter</a>, you'll notice that you can't write anything in the file.</p>
<p>If you press keys you will end up being able to write, even though you don't really know how you did it.</p>
<p>This happens because when starting Vim, the default mode is normal mode or command mode. This mode is used to view the file we want to open, move through it, and execute Vim commands.</p>
<p>In <a href="{{ url_for('chapter', cid=5) }}">the next chapter</a> we will explain how to move inside a file in Vim, but for the moment you can move the cursor in the file using the arrows on your keyboard.</p>
<p>To change modes, we have to use the keys on our keyboard.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Insert mode</h3>
<p>We use insert mode to write text to a file.</p>
<p>To enter insert mode press the <span class='clarification'>"i"</span> key from normal mode</p>
<p>You will see that you can now type with the cursor as you normally do.</p>
<p>You can check the current mode you are in by reading the text in the bar at the bottom left of your terminal. In insert mode, this bar will say something like <span class="clarification">"--INSERT--"</span></p>
<p>To return to normal mode, from where you can execute commands, use the escape key, if you press it twice quickly, you will return to normal mode faster.</p>
<p>To save the changes to a file in Vim, enter the command bar and type <span class="clarification">w</span>, that is <span class="clarification">:w</span></p>
<p>At the end of <a href="{{ url_for('chapter', cid=3) }}">chapter 3</a> we already explained how to exit Vim, but we will expand on that information. Use <span class="clarification">:q</span> to exit Vim.</p>
<p>If you want to exit saving changes to the file, use <span class="clarification">:w</span> and then <span class="clarification">:q</span>.</p>
<p>To avoid having to type two different commands, you can simplify this in <span class="clarification">:wq</span></p>
<p>And if you want to exit Vim without saving the changes, use <span class="clarification">:q!</span>.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Visual mode</h3>
<p>You can use the visual mode of vim for work with blocks of code at the same time<p>
<p>There are three ways for entering the visual mode<p>
<ol>
  <li class="v-li chapter-a">Character mode (v)</li>
  <li class="v-li chapter-a">Sentence mode (V)</li>
  <li class="v-li chapter-a">Block mode (Ctrl + v)</li>
<ol>
<p>To select a code block, you must move with the keyboard in the same way that you move the cursor in normal mode, with the h, j, k and l keys.</p>
<p>That will change the size of the selection in visual mode.</p>
<p>You can also use other navigation commands, such as <span="clarification">w</span> to highlight to the beginning of the next word or <span class="clarification">$</span> to include the rest of the line.</p>
<p>In the visual mode, you can press the <span class="clarification">d</span> key for deleting a chunk of code</p>
<p>If you deleted too much or not enough, press <span class="clarification">u (from undo)</span> to undo and start again.</p>
<p>You can also use the <p class="clarification">p</span> key for pasting this text in any other part of the document</p>
<p>The <span class="clarification">c</span> key will allow you to enter insert mode, which will let you replace a chunk of code.</p>
<p>As we have previously said, <span class="clarification">d</span> deletes the text chunk and copies it. <span class="clarification">y</span> is used to simply copy this text</p>
<p>You can use the sentence mode and the keys <span class="clarification">></span> and <span class="clarification"><</span> for increasing the identation of the lines you have selected</p>
<hr>
<h3>Command mode</h3>
<p>The command mode of the editor. It has multiple functions, in general it is used to execute vim script commands.</p>
<p>We will see more information about Vim script in future chapters.</p>
<p>Examples of commands in Vim script are <span class="clarification">:w</span> for saving the document, <span class="clarification">:q</span> for closing the document, <span class="clarification">:wq</span> for saving and closing or <span class="clarification">:q!</span> for closing without saving.</p>
<p>You can also use <span class="clarification">:help</span> for reading the documentation about an specific command.</p>
